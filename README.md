# nixagent

**Agentic AI clients — Claude Code, Claude Cowork, Gemini CLI, Codex, opencode, omp — declared per
host, on the hosts that actually want them, and delivered by whichever of two mechanisms keeps the
tool current: the distro's package manager, or the vendor's own installer. Never nixpkgs, because
they update themselves.**

## What this is

A platform-neutral catalogue (`lib/agents.nix`) naming each agent client's package identity, its
real command name and its vendor installer, plus **two modules for two delivery planes**:

**The distro plane** (`modules/nixagent.nix`, system-manager) resolves a selection into two lists a
host's Arch package reconciler can consume. Two groups: `cli` (terminal binaries) and `desktop`
(Electron windows).

```nix
nixagent.distro = "cachyos";               # or "arch" (the default)
nixagent.cli = [ "claude-code" "gemini-cli" "openai-codex" "opencode" "omp" ];
nixagent.desktop = [ "claude-cowork-linux" ];

nixarch.packages.pacman =
  config.nixagent.archPackages ++ config.nixagent.runtimeArchPackages;
nixarch.packages.aur    = config.nixagent.aurPackages;
```

**The upstream plane** (`modules/home.nix`, home-manager) runs the tool's *own* installer into the
vendor's *own* per-user prefix, once, and puts it on PATH. This is how a NixOS host gets these
tools at all — *given the host requirement below* — and how any host gets one whose distro package
has fallen behind.

```nix
nixagent.home.upstream = [ "claude-code" "omp" ];   # claude-code | omp | openai-codex | opencode
```

That is the whole surface. One top-level option namespace, `nixagent`, like every repo in this
family. The planes are independent and chosen **per host** — pacman/AUR on the Arch boxes, upstream
on NixOS, or upstream everywhere. Neither is forced and neither is the fallback.

## The rule this repo exists for: never nixpkgs — and the reason is not freshness

These tools **ship their own updater** and release on a cadence measured in days. A nix-store path
is read-only, so the updater cannot run at all — the version freezes until a human bumps a
`flake.lock`, and the tool spends the interval telling its operator to update while being
structurally unable to. A distro package is mutable enough that the system's own upgrade *is* the
updater, which is the outcome you want.

**That is the whole argument, and it is the only load-bearing one.** Freshness is a symptom of it,
not a second reason — and treating it as one has already gone wrong here once. Re-measured
2026-08-11 against nixpkgs-unstable HEAD, each project's release feed, and the Arch package API:

| Catalogue entry | nixpkgs-unstable | Arch / AUR | upstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude-code` | 2.1.226 | 2.1.222 (`cachyos`) | 2.1.226 |
| `opencode` | 1.18.13 | 1.18.16 (`extra`) | 1.18.16 |
| `openai-codex` | 0.147.0 | 0.146.1 (`extra`) | 0.147.0 |
| `gemini-cli` | 0.47.0 | 1:0.50.0 (`extra`) | 0.54.4 |
| `omp` | *absent* | 17.2.2 (AUR, flagged out of date) | 17.2.12 |

Read that honestly: nixpkgs is **ahead** of Arch for two of the five and level for a third. An
earlier revision of this README claimed every entry was behind its distro package. That was true of
the snapshot it was taken from and is false now — which is exactly why the rule does not rest on it.
Freshness changes hands week to week; immutability does not.

The one row that *is* catastrophic is `gemini-cli`, and it is not a packaging lag: nixpkgs marked
the package with a `meta.problems.removal` note on 2026-08-07 recording that Google is replacing
Gemini CLI with Antigravity CLI. A package being wound down is not evidence about nixpkgs' cadence.

(`omp` is the one entry nixpkgs genuinely does *not* carry — neither `omp` nor `oh-my-pi` exists
there, force-evaluated 2026-08-10. What does exist is `pkgs.pi-coding-agent` 0.83.0, homepage
`pi.dev`, main program `pi`: Mario Zechner's pi-mono, the project omp forked *from*. Reaching for it
because the npm name is `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent` installs a different agent under a different
command.)

The catalogue therefore carries **`nixpkgs = null` on every entry**, present rather than omitted so
that nobody mistakes the policy for an oversight, and `checks/agents-eval.nix` asserts it — an
addition that names a real nixpkgs attribute fails `nix flake check`. There is **no `nixosModules`
output**: not a gap to fill later, but the boundary the repo was drawn for. A NixOS host that wants
these tools uses the upstream plane below, which installs the vendor's own build and leaves its
updater working.

### What "never nixpkgs" does *not* mean

The prohibition is on nix owning the **tool**. It says nothing about nix supplying that tool's
**runtime** or its installer's dependencies. `programs.nix-ld` providing a dynamic loader,
`nixagent.home.extraPath` handing the vendor's script a nixpkgs `curl` and `bash`, and Codex's
declarative `bubblewrap` runtime are not exceptions to the rule — they are the rule working. Nix
builds the ground the vendor's artifact stands on; the artifact stays the vendor's, mutable, and
updatable by its own updater.

### Codex sandbox prerequisite

On Linux, selecting `openai-codex` also selects the distribution's `bubblewrap` package. Codex uses
the first `bwrap` on `PATH`; without it, the client warns and falls back to a bundled helper whose
operation depends on unprivileged user namespaces. The declared package is the reliable setup
recommended by the [official sandbox prerequisites](https://developers.openai.com/codex/concepts/sandboxing#prerequisites).

- Distro plane: `nixagent.runtimeArchPackages = [ "bubblewrap" ]`, wired into pacman beside
  `archPackages`.
- Upstream/home-manager plane: `pkgs.bubblewrap` enters `home.packages`; Codex itself remains
  installed by the vendor and absent from the Nix store.

## The second delivery mode, and the measurement that forced it

The argument above is about nixpkgs and it holds. What it does *not* establish is that a distro
package is always current — and the same table shows it measurably is not. `omp` is ten patch
releases behind upstream in the AUR, with an `omp-updater` bot listed as co-maintainer on *both*
packages and both flagged out of date; `opencode` and `gemini-cli` trail their own releases in
Arch `extra`. A packager — even an automated one — is a human in the loop of a project that ships
several times a week, and for a fast enough project the AUR pins as badly as nixpkgs would.

So there is a second plane, and its contract is one sentence:

> **Nix ensures the tool exists and is on PATH. Nix never owns it.**

No agent client in `home.packages`, no `home.file` for a binary, no hash and no version anywhere —
`checks/home-eval.nix` asserts that boundary. A distro-owned runtime such as Codex's `bubblewrap`
may be in `home.packages`; the agent itself never is. Afterwards `claude update`, `omp`'s
self-update and the rest keep working, which is the whole point.

The two modes answer different questions, and neither wins globally:

| | distro plane | upstream plane |
|---|---|---|
| Updates via | `pacman -Syu`, with the host's other packages | the tool's own updater |
| Freshness bounded by | a packager | the vendor's own release |
| Needs | a package manager and (for AUR) a helper | `curl`, a `$HOME`, **and a dynamic loader** |
| Works on NixOS | no | yes — *only with `programs.nix-ld`*, see below |
| Removes cleanly | **yes** — pacman owns the files | **no** — nothing owns the files |

That last row is the honest cost: deselecting a tool on the upstream plane leaves the binary
exactly where it was. Full write-up:
[`studies/the-aur-lags-upstream-too.md`](studies/the-aur-lags-upstream-too.md).

### Host requirement: a dynamic loader for foreign binaries

Three of the four catalogued installers deliver an **x86-64 glibc executable** declaring
`INTERP /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`, a path NixOS does not have.

So on NixOS the upstream plane needs `programs.nix-ld`, and needs it *configured*, not merely
enabled — a host with nix-ld in the closure but nothing behind it installs a **stub** at that path
whose entire job is to refuse. That state passes a naive existence check and fails at run time, so
`lib/install-upstream.sh` tests for it by name and aborts in `stage: preflight` with the option to
set, before anything is downloaded.

```nix
programs.nix-ld.enable = true;
programs.nix-ld.libraries = with pkgs; [ stdenv.cc.cc.lib zlib openssl ];
```

Claude's installer cannot route around this by picking its musl build: its libc detection is
`[ -f /lib/libc.musl-*.so.1 ] || ldd /bin/ls | grep -q musl`, and NixOS has no `/bin/ls`, so it
selects the glibc artifact on exactly the hosts that cannot run it.

**It is per entry, and `openai-codex` is why.** The catalogue field is `needsDynamicLoader` — named
after the host requirement, not after the artifact, because codex ships the *largest* native binary
here (a 258 MB Rust executable) and needs no loader at all: every Linux asset is
`x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, and its program headers carry no `INTERP` segment, so it is a static
PIE that starts on a bare NixOS host. Flagging it by "is this a native binary" would have imposed a
prerequisite it does not have and refused installs that would have worked.

### How idempotency and failure work

One `test -x` on the vendor's own launcher path, per selected tool, per activation. Present →
nothing is fetched, nothing is printed, no subprocess runs. That is the entire cost on a machine
that already has the tool, and it also protects the tool's self-updates: re-running a vendor
installer over a self-updated install is how a current tool gets rolled *back*.

When the tool is absent, the installer is downloaded **to a file** and only then run — never
`curl | sh`, because a pipeline's exit status is its last command's, so a failed fetch is handed to
a shell that reads nothing and exits 0. A zero exit from the installer is then not treated as
evidence of anything: the expected path must exist, be executable, and answer `--version` before
the activation is allowed to succeed. Each stage failure prints a labelled block naming the stage,
the installer's own output and the fact that the command is unavailable, and by default fails the
switch (`nixagent.home.onInstallFailure = "warn"` downgrades it for a laptop that switches
offline — quieter, never silent).

Full reasoning, including what each vendor installer actually does:
[`studies/upstream-installers-disagree-about-everything.md`](studies/upstream-installers-disagree-about-everything.md).

## Why these are not nixllm's, and not nixsh's

Package delivery in this family is split by **domain**, and these clients had no owner.

**Not [nixllm](https://github.com/julian-corbet/nixllm-corbet-ch).** That repo *serves* models — a
broker, an inference engine, a model store, a GPU. Everything here, `desktop` group included, is an
HTTPS client that never loads a weight and has no opinion about a GPU. Same project space, opposite
side of the wire, and a shared catalogue would mean one repo whose entries need two unrelated kinds
of host to be useful.

**Not [nixsh](https://github.com/julian-corbet/nixsh-corbet-ch)**, despite most of these being
terminal tools. nixsh is universal *by construction* — every host has a shell and reaches for a
terminal tool, which is exactly why that catalogue has no per-host story to build. These do not have that
property and must not inherit it: a small production server has a shell and wants `ripgrep`, and
emphatically does not want a self-updating agent CLI and its runtime. "Runs in a terminal" is a
shape; nixsh's claim is the *domain* "every host needs this", and these fail it.

The placement rule, stated in `lib/agents.nix`'s own header so the next candidate is decidable
rather than argued:

> Does the tool drive a remote frontier model it does not host, delivered as a package that
> self-updates faster than nixpkgs tracks it? Yes → here, catalogued as `cli` or `desktop` by
> whichever interface it actually has. No → whichever repo owns the thing it actually is.

Whether the tool opens a terminal or a window is *not* the eligibility test — see
[`studies/claude-cowork-is-a-desktop-app-not-a-cli.md`](studies/claude-cowork-is-a-desktop-app-not-a-cli.md)
for why that clause was dropped from it.

## The AUR/pacman split, and why it is not the same answer on every host

`pacman -S` resolves a transaction **atomically**: one unresolvable target aborts the whole
converge with `target not found` and takes every unrelated package in the same list down with it.
So `archPackages` and `aurPackages` are separate outputs, and that they never intersect is the
load-bearing invariant `checks/` exists to hold.

One entry makes this harder than it looks. `claude-code` is in **no upstream Arch repository** —
archlinux.org's package search returns nothing for it — but it *is* in the AUR, and CachyOS's own
repository carries it too. It resolves cleanly under `pacman -Si` on a CachyOS box, which is
exactly the observation that would tempt you into `aur = false` and hand every plain Arch consumer
a broken transaction.

The two errors are not symmetric, so the design follows the asymmetry:

- `aur = true` is the **floor** for anything upstream Arch does not package — the direction that
  cannot abort a transaction, since an AUR helper resolves repository packages first and builds
  nothing that did not need building.
- `archRepoOn = [ "cachyos" ]` lifts it to the pacman list, but only on a distro whose own
  repository is known to carry it.
- `nixagent.distro` defaults to `"arch"`, the recoverable answer, rather than to whichever distro
  the catalogue happened to be written on.

## Package name ≠ command name ≠ catalogue key

Four of the six disagree, so `nixagent.binaries` publishes the mapping. Pointing an alias, a
wrapper or a home-manager config at the *package* name gets you a command that does not exist.

| Selection (catalogue key) | pacman package | command | vendor installer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude-code` | `claude-code` | `claude` | `claude.ai/install.sh` → `~/.local/bin/claude` |
| `gemini-cli` | `gemini-cli` | `gemini` | — (npm/Node only; no installer, and no Linux release asset in any of the last 15 releases) |
| `openai-codex` | `openai-codex` | `codex` | `chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh` → `~/.local/bin/codex` |
| `opencode` | `opencode` | `opencode` | `opencode.ai/install` → `~/.opencode/bin/opencode` |
| `omp` | `oh-my-pi-bin` | `omp` | `omp.sh/install` → `~/.local/bin/omp` |
| `claude-cowork-linux` | `claude-cowork-linux` | `claude-cowork` | — (third-party repackaging) |

`omp` is the sharpest case and the reason the key is documented as naming the **tool**: the project
calls itself `omp`, the AUR calls it `oh-my-pi-bin`, npm calls it `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`, and
the command is `omp`. Four names, no two the same. The key cannot be "the pacman name" now that it
is also what a consumer writes on the home-manager plane, where the AUR does not exist and a `-bin`
suffix means nothing.

`upstream = null` is a **recorded finding**, not a blank — each such entry carries what was checked
and why npm was not accepted as a substitute. `nixagent.home.upstream` is typed to the entries that
have an installer, so naming one that does not is an eval error rather than an activation that
quietly fetches nothing.

**A finding is not a verdict — re-probe it.** `openai-codex` carried `upstream = null` from
2026-08-07 to 2026-08-11 on a recorded *403 from `openai.com/codex/install.sh`*. That URL is not
OpenAI's and never served the installer; the real one is in the project README and answers 200. A
403 is a fact about a URL, and reading it as a fact about a tool kept codex off every NixOS host
here for four days. When an entry blocks a host, check the vendor's own documented command before
concluding the vendor ships nothing.

## What this does not own

- **Configuration of the agents themselves** — API keys, model choice, MCP servers, permission
  rules. This repo delivers binaries and publishes names. That it now *has* a home-manager module
  does not change this: `modules/home.nix` exists because an installer needs a user and a `$HOME`,
  not because agent configuration moved in. Per-user agent config lives wherever the consumer
  already keeps it, and `nixagent.home.binaries`/`paths` are published so it can point at the real
  command instead of guessing it from a package name.
- **Updating anything.** On the distro plane that is `pacman -Syu`'s job; on the upstream plane it
  is the tool's own updater's, and preserving that is the reason the plane exists. Nothing here
  re-runs an installer over a tool that is already present.
- **Removing anything from the upstream plane.** Nothing owns those files, so deselecting a tool
  leaves the binary in place. Stated plainly rather than papered over — the distro plane does not
  have this limitation, and that is a real reason to prefer it on a host that has a reconciler.
- **Local inference of any kind** — engines, model runners, weight converters. Those load weights,
  which is nixllm's domain by the boundary above, not a matter of taste.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `flake.nix` | Flake entry point: `systemManagerModules`, `homeManagerModules`, `lib.catalogue`, `lib.policy`, `checks`. No `nixosModules` — see above. |
| `lib/agents.nix` | The catalogue: one entry per agent client, with its pacman name, command, AUR status, vendor installer, runtime prerequisites, and the policy `nixpkgs = null` for the client itself. |
| `lib/install-upstream.sh` | The upstream plane's shell half: one sourceable function that probes, fetches, runs and **verifies** a vendor installer. Inlined into the activation script by `modules/home.nix` and executed for real by `checks/upstream-install.nix` — one implementation, not a copy. |
| `modules/nixagent.nix` | Distro plane: options, catalogue resolution, and the published `archPackages`/`aurPackages`/`binaries`. Also *is* the Arch backend — there is nothing platform-specific left for a second file to hold. |
| `modules/home.nix` | Upstream plane: `nixagent.home.*`, one activation entry, `home.sessionPath`, and the published `binaries`/`paths`/`prefixes`. |
| `checks/agents-eval.nix` | The distro plane and the catalogue's own shape, via `lib.evalModules`. |
| `checks/home-eval.nix` | The upstream plane's rendering, via `lib.evalModules` against a stub of the home-manager options it writes to. |
| `checks/upstream-install.nix` + `.sh` | The only check that **runs** something: `lib/install-upstream.sh` shellchecked, then executed against a stubbed `curl` through eleven cases. |
| `experiments/verify-package-names.sh` | Hand-run verification of every name against upstream Arch, the AUR (with out-of-date flags) and the local pacman, plus a live fetch of every vendor installer URL. |
| `studies/` | Written-up findings that changed a decision here. |

## Platform support

**Arch / CachyOS (via system-manager):** the distro plane's target. Publishes package-name lists
for the host's own reconciler; installs nothing itself, because on Arch there is no installer here
to call.

**Any host with home-manager, NixOS included (via home-manager):** the upstream plane. Installs the
vendor's own build into the vendor's own per-user prefix and puts it on PATH. This is the *only*
way these tools arrive on a NixOS host from this repo — `nixosModules` remains deliberately absent,
because it could only mean `environment.systemPackages` of the frozen derivations the nixpkgs rule
refuses.

Both planes can run on the same host for different tools. They share no state — system-manager and
home-manager are separate evaluations with no common `config` — so the one case where they collide
(the same command arriving from both) is reported at activation time, where both are finally
visible, rather than pretended away at eval time.

## Checks

Three, all wired to `nix flake check`.

**`agents-eval`** evaluates `modules/nixagent.nix` via `lib.evalModules` and asserts, among others:
an empty selection resolves to nothing on both lists; every catalogue group (`cli` and `desktop`)
has a matching option and contributes; `archPackages` and `aurPackages` never intersect on *either*
distro setting; every selection lands on exactly one list; every entry still carries
`nixpkgs = null`; every entry carries an `upstream` field whose `installs` is relative to `$HOME`
and ends in that entry's own `binary`; catalogue keys are unique across groups; `claude-code` moves
between the lists with `nixagent.distro` and is never on both; and `claude-cowork-linux` and `omp`
— which carry no `archRepoOn` — stay on the AUR list on *every* distro setting.

**`home-eval`** evaluates `modules/home.nix` against a stub of the home-manager options it writes
to, and asserts what it renders: one activation entry rather than one per tool, after
`writeBoundary`; every call prefixed with home-manager's dry-run hook, so `home-manager build` can
never install anything; the probe path and command taken from the catalogue rather than the key or
the package name; `--binary` and `--no-modify-path` present where they are load-bearing; codex's
`--env 'CODEX_NON_INTERACTIVE=1'` rendered as one quoted word and on no other entry; the loader
flag emitted per entry and **absent** on codex; each vendor's own prefix on `home.sessionPath`,
deduplicated; a selection with no vendor installer refused at eval time while `openai-codex` is
accepted; and — mechanising the contract — **no agent client in `home.packages`, no `home.file`, no
version, hash or store path anywhere in the rendered script**. Codex is the one selection with a
`home.packages` member, and that member is exactly `pkgs.bubblewrap`, its distro-owned runtime.

**`upstream-install`** shellchecks `lib/install-upstream.sh` and then *runs* it against a stubbed
`curl` through thirteen cases, including: it installs when the tool is absent; on a second
activation it invokes curl **zero** times *with the network stubbed to fail*, so even an attempt
would be fatal; a 404 and an HTML error page and a non-zero installer each produce a labelled
diagnostic carrying the installer's own output; an installer that exits 0 having installed nothing
**fails**; a binary that installs but cannot start fails; `--env` values reach the installer's
environment intact (spaces included) while a malformed one is a hard error that fetches nothing;
the installer sees its own destination on `PATH` and therefore writes no shell rc file; `warn` mode
does not abort but still prints; and a malformed call is never downgraded by `warn`.

Every assertion in all three was confirmed to actually fail when the thing it guards is broken.
For the behaviour suite that was done by mutation: removing the idempotency gate, the
installed-path check, the not-a-script check, the `--version` smoke test, curl's status capture,
and warn mode's early return each trip their own cases and nothing else. On the eval side, dropping
`--binary` from the catalogue, making an `installs` path absolute, adding a `home.packages` entry,
and removing the dry-run hook each trip exactly one named assertion.
