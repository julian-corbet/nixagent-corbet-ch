# Reproduces the verification every `arch` name in lib/agents.nix was checked against before being
# committed. Run it by hand after touching the catalogue -- repository membership is a fact about
# the world, it changes without this repo changing, and no eval-time check can see it (that is
# exactly the line checks/agents-eval.nix's own header draws around itself).
#
# THREE SOURCES, NOT ONE, and the third is not optional. `pacman -Si` reports which repository a
# name resolves in ON THIS HOST -- which on an Arch DERIVATIVE includes that derivative's own
# repositories. A name can therefore pass `pacman -Si` cleanly and still be in no upstream Arch
# repository at all, which would make `aur = false` correct on the machine running this script and
# a whole-transaction abort on a plain Arch box ("target not found" fails a `pacman -S` atomically
# and takes every unrelated package in the same converge with it). That is not hypothetical: it is
# `claude-code`, the reason `archRepoOn` exists. So:
#
#   1. archlinux.org's package search API  -- upstream Arch, the authority for `aur = false`.
#   2. the AUR RPC                         -- the authority for `aur = true`.
#   3. `pacman -Si`, if pacman is present  -- informational: shows what THIS host resolves, and
#                                             confirms an `archRepoOn` derivative claim when run
#                                             on that derivative.
#
# The nixpkgs side is inverted here compared to every sibling repo's version of this script: there
# is nothing to resolve, because the catalogue's `nixpkgs = null` is a POLICY (these tools
# self-update; a read-only store path cannot run their updater, and nixpkgs measurably lags them --
# see lib/agents.nix's header). That policy is enforced at eval time by checks/agents-eval.nix, so
# it is not re-checked here.
#
# THE SECOND DELIVERY MODE IS CHECKED HERE TOO, and it needs this file more than the first one
# does. `upstream.url` in lib/agents.nix is a vendor-controlled URL that can 404, move, or start
# answering with an HTML error page, and none of that changes anything in this repo. checks/ cannot
# see it (a pure evaluation has no network) and checks/upstream-install.nix deliberately stubs curl
# so it tests behaviour rather than the internet. So the live question -- does each installer still
# answer, and is what comes back still a shell script -- is asked here, by hand.
#
# The AUR pass also reports each package's VERSION and out-of-date flag rather than just its
# existence. That is not decoration: an AUR name that exists but is ten releases behind is the
# whole finding behind studies/the-aur-lags-upstream-too.md, and a run of this script is where an
# operator would notice it happening again.
#
# NAMES ARE READ OUT OF lib/agents.nix, never hand-maintained in this file -- a duplicated list
# goes stale in both directions, silently skipping entries that were added and still "verifying"
# entries that were removed.
