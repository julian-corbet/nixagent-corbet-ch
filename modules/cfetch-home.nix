# nixagent's cfetch plane, HOME side: the per-user surface the binary needs to actually act as a
# session brain — the config file, the warm daemon, and the idempotent hook/MCP registration.
# The BINARY arrives on the system plane (./cfetch.nix → the host's AUR reconciler) or from
# cfetch's own flake on a NixOS host; this module never installs it and tolerates its absence
# (a registration that ran before the package landed retries on the next activation).
#
# Why home-manager: everything cfetch touches at registration time is per-user state
# (~/.claude/settings.json, ~/.codex, ~/.gemini, ~/.config/cfetch, a systemd USER unit) — the
# same "a per-user prefix is a per-user concern" line ./home.nix draws for the vendor installers.
#
# The registration is an activation script and not home.file, for the reason infra's own
# claudeBrainLinks records: these files pre-exist unmanaged on every current machine, and
# home.file aborts the whole activation on an existing path it does not own. `cfetch install` is
# the tool's OWN idempotent merge (tagged entries, marker blocks), which is strictly better at
# adopting existing state than anything rendered here could be.
