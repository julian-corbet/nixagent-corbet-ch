#
# nixagent's policy module: the selection surface, the catalogue resolution, and the package-name
# lists a host's own reconciler consumes. Installs nothing itself.
#
# THIS MODULE IS ALSO THE ARCH BACKEND, and there is deliberately no second file behind
# `systemManagerModules.default`. Same conclusion nixmsg reached for itself once its one
# platform-specific job moved elsewhere: on Arch there is no installer here to call, so an
# `arch.nix` whose entire body was `imports = [ ./nixagent.nix ];` would be a file that exists to
# be an indirection. The lists below are published; the host wires them:
#
#   nixarch.packages.pacman = config.nixagent.archPackages
#                              ++ config.nixagent.runtimeArchPackages;
#   nixarch.packages.aur    = config.nixagent.aurPackages;
#
# PUBLISHED, NOT WIRED, and that is a choice rather than an omission. This module could assign
# `nixarch.packages.*` directly (nixremote's own system-manager plane does exactly that for its
# install flags). It does not, for the reason nixsh/nixmsg/nixllm all also do not: a host almost
# always concatenates several catalogues into one reconciler list, and a module that assigns into
# a FOREIGN namespace both hard-depends on that namespace existing and takes the concatenation
# point away from the one file that can see all the catalogues at once.
#
# THERE IS NO NixOS BACKEND, AND THERE WILL NOT BE. Every catalogue entry carries `nixpkgs = null`
# by policy -- these tools self-update and nixpkgs lags them, both measured, see ../lib/agents.nix's
# own header for the numbers. So there is no `nixosPackages` option here and no `nixosModules`
# output in the flake: not a gap to fill later, but the boundary this repo was drawn for. A NixOS
# host that composes this module gets options it can set and lists nothing reads, which is the
# honest outcome -- better than an `environment.systemPackages` path that would silently install
# the frozen copy this repo exists to refuse.
#
# ONE NAMESPACE. Everything declared here lives under `nixagent`, like every repo in this family.

        Which Arch-family distribution this host runs. Read for ONE purpose: deciding whether a
        catalogue entry that is AUR-only upstream can come from a derivative's own repository
        instead (`archRepoOn` in lib/agents.nix).

        Defaults to "arch", the FLOOR rather than the common case, because the two answers fail
        differently. Declaring "arch" on a CachyOS host costs a package a trip through the AUR
        helper, which then finds it in a repository anyway -- an AUR helper resolves repository
        packages first, so nothing is built from source that did not need to be. Declaring
        "cachyos" on a plain Arch host puts a name pacman cannot resolve into the pacman list, and
        `pacman -S` fails a transaction ATOMICALLY: one unresolvable target aborts the whole
        converge with "target not found" and takes every unrelated package in it down. A default
        can only be wrong in one of those directions, so it is wrong in the recoverable one.

        Declared, never probed -- same reasoning nixarch states for its own identically-valued
        `nixarch.packages.distro`: this module is evaluated wherever the flake is built, which is
        not necessarily the machine it targets, so eval-time detection would as often as not read
        the wrong host's identity. Set it to match the box, alongside whatever the host already
        tells nixarch.

        Currently this is `bubblewrap` when `openai-codex` is selected. Codex's Linux sandbox

        prerequisite; the bundled helper is only a fallback.

        Non-empty means the host needs a working AUR helper (and, for an unattended reconciler,
        whatever non-root user and sudo rule that helper requires). If it has neither, prefer
        leaving the selection out over declaring something that will be reported as installed and
