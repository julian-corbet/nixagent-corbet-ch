# Evaluates modules/nixagent.nix for real against `lib.evalModules` and asserts what it resolves --
# the same "Nix inspecting Nix" tier as nixsh's checks/tools-eval.nix, and here for the same reason
# that file states: `nix flake check` does NOT evaluate `systemManagerModules` on its own, so a
# green check on this repo without a file like this one would prove nothing but flake syntax.
#
# Deliberately pkgs-FREE beyond `pkgs.emptyFile` for the derivation shell. Every question this
# repo can actually answer at eval time is a question about NAMES and LISTS -- which group a key
# belongs to, which side of the pacman/AUR split a name lands on for a given distro, whether the
# nixpkgs prohibition still holds -- and none of them needs a package set. Unlike its siblings this
# repo has no nixpkgs-resolution half to check at all: `nixpkgs = null` everywhere is the policy,
# and asserting THAT is one of the checks below rather than something a real `pkgs` would help with.
#
# SCOPE, now that there are two delivery modes. This file owns the SYSTEM plane
# (../modules/nixagent.nix: the pacman/AUR split) plus every assertion about the CATALOGUE itself,
# including the shape of the `upstream` field the second mode reads. How that field resolves into
# a home-manager activation is ./home-eval.nix, and whether the resulting script actually behaves
# is ./upstream-install.nix -- which runs it rather than asserting about it.
#
# What can NOT be proven here, and is not pretended: whether `claude-code` is in a given
# repository today, or whether an installer URL still answers. Those are facts about the world,
# they change without this repo changing, and they are verified out of band against live sources
# -- see ../experiments/verify-package-names.sh.
