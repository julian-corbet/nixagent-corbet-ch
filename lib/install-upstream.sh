# shellcheck shell=bash
#
# nixagent -- the UPSTREAM delivery mode, shell half. Defines one function and nothing else, so
# this file is `source`-able: ../modules/home.nix inlines it verbatim into a single home-manager
# activation entry and then calls the function once per selected tool, and ../checks/
# upstream-install.nix sources the SAME file and drives the function directly against a stubbed
# curl. One implementation, exercised by the tests that guard it -- not a copy of it.
#
# ── THE CONTRACT: NIX ENSURES THE TOOL EXISTS, NIX NEVER OWNS IT ───────────────────────────────
#
# Everything below runs the VENDOR's own installer into the VENDOR's own per-user prefix, and then
# gets out of the way. Nothing here writes a version number, a hash, a lock file or a store path,
# and nothing here ever runs a second time on a machine that already has the tool. That is
# deliberate and it is the whole point: these tools ship their own updater, `<tool> update` must
# keep working afterwards, and a nix-managed copy -- read-only store path or not -- takes that
# away. See ../lib/agents.nix's header for the measurements behind the policy, including the ones
# showing the AUR lagging as badly as nixpkgs for a fast-moving entry.
#
# So the post-condition this function enforces is "the command EXISTS and runs", never "the
# command is version X". An operator who wants a specific version runs the tool's own updater.
#
# ── WHY NOT `curl ... | sh` ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Every one of these vendors documents `curl -fsSL <url> | sh`. Do not do that from an activation
# script. A pipeline's exit status is its LAST command's, so a failed fetch -- DNS, a captive
# portal, a 404, a proxy returning an error page -- is handed to `sh`, which reads it, finds
# nothing to run, and exits 0. The switch then reports success having installed nothing, which is
# exactly the class of failure these hosts have been bitten by often enough to build a rule around.
# `set -o pipefail` would fix the status but not the "200 OK, here is an HTML error page" case.
#
# Downloading to a file first makes curl's own exit status the answer, and lets the content be
# looked at before it is executed. Both checks are below, and both have a test.
#
# ── THE THREE THINGS THAT ARE VERIFIED AFTER THE INSTALLER RETURNS ─────────────────────────────
#
# An installer exiting 0 is not evidence that anything was installed; it is evidence that nothing
# crashed. So a zero exit is followed by: the expected path exists, it is executable, and it
# answers `--version`. The last one is not paranoia -- omp's own installer does exactly this to
# itself (scripts/install.sh, the SMOKE_OUTPUT block: a musl build downloads fine and then dies
# with relocation errors, so the download succeeding proves nothing). Every catalogued installer's
# binary answers `--version`; a future tool that does not would need a catalogue field for its
# equivalent, and until one exists inventing the field would be speculative surface.
#
# ── REQUIRES bash ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Arrays and `local`. Home-manager's activation script is bash, and the check runs it under bash.
# The INSTALLERS are run with whichever interpreter their own shebang and docs specify, which is
# not always bash -- that is the `--runner` argument, per catalogue entry.

# nixagent_install_upstream
#   --name NAME              catalogue key, for messages only
#   --command CMD            the command the tool installs (`claude`, not `claude-code`)

#   --runner bash|sh         interpreter to run it with
#   [--needs-dynamic-loader] what the installer lands requires /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --
#                            preflighted before anything is downloaded. NOT "is it a native
#                            binary": codex's artifact is a static-PIE musl executable with no
#                            INTERP segment and needs no loader at all. See lib/agents.nix.
#   [--env NAME=VALUE]       exported for the installer run only; repeatable
#   [--needs CMD]            a command this installer hard-requires, preflighted by name;
#                            repeatable. See lib/agents.nix's `needs` field for why.
#   [--on-failure abort|warn]  default abort
#   [--connect-timeout N]      default 10  (seconds)
#   [--max-time N]             default 600 (seconds)
#   [-- ARGS...]             flags passed to the installer, from the catalogue entry
#
# `--probe` is relative to $HOME, resolved here at ACTIVATION time, rather than an absolute path
# baked in at eval time. Two reasons, one practical and one structural: the check can point a fake
# HOME at a scratch directory and exercise the real function, and a home-manager evaluation that
# is built on one machine and activated as a different user cannot bake the wrong home in.
#
# Exit status: 0 on success or a skip, 1 on a failed install under `--on-failure abort`, 2 on a
# malformed call. 2 is never downgraded by `--on-failure warn`: a bad argument list is a bug in
# this repo, not a network condition, and hiding it behind a warning would hide the bug.

    # ../checks/upstream-install.nix drives fake shell installers inside a nix sandbox, which has
    # no FHS, and an unconditional test failed 25 of its 48 cases.)
    #
    # THE FLAG IS ABOUT THE REQUIREMENT, NOT ABOUT THE ARTIFACT, and the distinction is not
    # academic: three of the four catalogued installers deliver an x86-64 GLIBC executable
    # reporting `INTERP /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` (verified by range-fetching the release
    # artifacts), while codex delivers the largest native binary of the lot as a static-PIE musl
    # build with no INTERP segment at all -- it starts fine on a host with no FHS and no nix-ld.
    # Flagging it by "is it native" would have imposed a prerequisite it does not have.
    #
    # For the three that do need it: a distribution that does not provide that path cannot run
    # them, and the failure surfaces as ENOENT on the LOADER, which the shell reports as "no such
    # file or directory" naming a binary that plainly exists -- one of the least legible errors in
    # Unix, and worth spending a preflight to never see.

    # is. So an unconfigured NixOS host passes a naive `[ -e ]` and fails anyway, later, after a
    # download and with a worse message.

    # on their own failure path: omp's downloads the binary, chmod +x's it, smoke-tests it and
    # `exit 1`s WITHOUT removing it; opencode's has no smoke test at all, so a truncated or
    # wrong-architecture download lands executable and is only caught by the `--version` probe
    # below. On a host with no dynamic loader for these glibc binaries (see README, "Host
    # requirements") that is the ordinary outcome rather than the rare one.
    #
    # So the artifact goes. Removing it costs one re-download on the next activation; keeping it
    # costs the ability to ever notice again. `rm -f` and not a guarded test: it follows the same
    # convention as the `-x` gate, and a dangling symlink -- a version directory pruned out from
    # under the entry point -- must be cleared too, which `[ -e ]` would report as absent.
    #
    # A binary that installed correctly but whose `--version` cannot start is deleted by this too.
    # That is intended and not collateral: this plane's claim is "installed AND verified", and an
    # unverifiable binary it silently kept would be exactly the claim it must not make.
