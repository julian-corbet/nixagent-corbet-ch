    # installs a nixpkgs derivation at all (see modules/nixagent.nix's header: there is no NixOS

      # exists and never owns it. This is how a NixOS host gets these tools, and how ANY host gets
      # one whose distro package has fallen behind (measured: the AUR carried omp 17.2.2/17.2.3
      # against an upstream 17.2.12 on 2026-08-10, both flagged out of date). Independent of the

      # step towards one -- it is the reason one is still not needed. Every catalogue entry is
      # `nixpkgs = null` by policy: these tools ship their own updater, which a read-only store
      # path cannot run, and nixpkgs measurably lags every one of them (lib/agents.nix's header
      # carries the numbers). A `nixosModules` output could only mean `environment.systemPackages`
      # of exactly those frozen derivations. A NixOS host that wants these tools composes
      # `homeManagerModules.nixagent` instead, which installs the vendor's own build and leaves
      # its updater working. The absence is the repo's boundary, not an unfinished corner.

      # Policy alone, for a consumer that wants the computed lists and will wire them itself, plus
      # the raw catalogue for inspection without re-reading the file. Same split as nixsh's own

      # `upstream-install` is the odd one out and the important one: it is not an eval-time
      # assertion but a RUN of lib/install-upstream.sh against a stubbed curl, because a delivery
      # mode whose idempotency and failure behaviour are only asserted on paper is a delivery mode
      # nobody can trust. Note that it therefore does real work only under a plain `nix flake
      # check`; `--no-build` evaluates it and stops.
